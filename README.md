# Capstone-Project
Description
Miguel lives in the North-West side of Toronto in Downsview where he enjoys what his neighbourhood has to offer, such as bars, restaurants, cafes and parks. He recently received a job offer in South-East Toronto at the Studio District, the career prospects at this new company represent what he was looking for and he is interested in taking this job. The problem is Miguel now has to move closer to his new job as commuting if not feasible from the place he lives as the salary is high enough he is not concerned about the rent prices, he is just focused on his social life thus venues and facilities nearby is what is the most important for him. There are plenty of options in the surrounding areas but he would like to choose the perfect location with venues similar to the ones of his neighbourhood. 

To solve this problem Miguel is thinking about getting a list of all the possible neighbourhoods in the city where he can move to, data regarding to the venues and facilities. This data will be taken from Foursquare where he will pull all the venues for each neighbourhood on Miguelâ€™s options. Based on this data, he will build a classification model to help him determine the most suitable location for him.
